                <h3>Mindsets & Leverage Points</h3>
                <p>Leverage is using whatever assets you posses to help achieve a goal in the most efficient manner. Leveraging your content is one of the best ways to maximize the resources that you’ve created while saving you lots of time. We believe that being a leader is a mindset, much more than it is a title. And codifying the operating principles that leaders at grofers follow at all times. Be Less Stressed, Happier, and More Mindful. </p>

                <h3>Learning Organisation</h3>
                <p>We are a group of people who are constantly learning the skills we need, and continuously improving upon ourselves to create the future we desire. One of the main benefits being a learning organization offers is a competitive advantage. This competitive advantage can be founded on different strategies, which can be acquired by organizational learning. One way of gaining a competitive advantage is strategic flexibility.</p>

    <p class="teampara">Everyone says it, but in our case it’s true: our team is the secret to our success. Each of our employees is amazing in their own right, but together they are what makes Rostrum such a fun and rewarding place to work. We’re very proud of the team we’ve built – there’s more than thirty of us now but it still feels like it did when there were just a few of us.</p>
